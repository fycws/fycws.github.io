<h2>Why is OPSR-JA Almost double the size of any other resource pack?</h2>
<p>OPSR-JA Follows a quality textured and photorealism way which already increases the overall pack size a lot but OPSR-JA also provides a built-in backup for linux based systems which doubles the pack size.</p>

<h2>Drivers of OPSR-JA</h2>
<p>OPSR-JA has built-in drivers which are responsible for providing every service to you for example the service could be updating, backing up or anything else. The drivers are extremely important for this resource and the drivers are also fully open source and safe to use and even modify.</p>
<p>Check the "/src/drivers/code/" for drivers source code</p>

<h3>Can we update drivers?</h3>
<p>Yes, OPSR-JA Provides drivers separately in releases meaning you may be able to update your OPSR-JA drivers with ease.</p>

<h3>How to update drivers?</h3>
<p>If you want to update OPSR-JA drivers then you must be using a linux based system because OPSR-JA Only provides drivers for linux based systems only. You must be familiar with CLI tools of linux and terminal of your operating system.</p>

<h4>Suggested Systems:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Debian</li>
    <li>Ubuntu</li>
    <li>Arch</li>
    <li>Manjaro</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry even if your distribution is different but if it is linux based then it may run drivers as well.</p>

<p>Let's suppose you are using a linux based system and want to update the drivers of OPSR-JA then follow the steps but do not follow them if you are using Windows or MAC or anything else.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Locate the Pack file (Typically in "/home/[user]/.minecraft/resourcepacks/")</li>
    <li>Extract the Resource pack file to a different location (e.g.: "/home/Documents/RP/")</li>
    <li>Extract the pack.</li>
    <li>Locate your drivers.</li>
    <li>Extract your Drivers.</li>
    <li>Copy your drivers all files and folders.</li>
    <li>Paste the copied content in the root directory of the extracted resource pack and if it asks for replacing then replace the old drivers with new.</li>
    <li>Re-brand and Compress the content after copying done.</li>
    <li>Paste your resource pack in your resourcepacks directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations!! You have successfully updated your old drivers.</p>

<h3>What if I do not update drivers?</h3>
<p>OPSR-JA never forces to update the drivers always because drivers are not designed for running the resource pack but for providing technical features for resource pack for example, upscaling, backup etc. If you won't update your drivers then it's totally fine your pack will still run fine as expected and updating drivers also means the new texture files must be added otherwise it may result bugs in-game. So generally updating drivers is good for accessing new features only but updating drivers in an older version of resource pack will definitely leave bugs in game. So do not update them until you really want to access new features because the drivers released with every updated versions of the resource pack and your OPSR-JA will already have its stable drivers and those drivers are designed to work with your version of OPSR-JA means they will run extremely fine and smoothly where new drivers in old versions may lead to glitches or bugs or even crash your game.</p>

<h3>In which language are the drivers written?</h3>
<p>OPSR-JA uses a combination of programming languages but all of them are low level because most of the part of drivers of OPSR-JA are written in C++ but some of them are written in Zile which is a custom programming language of ghgltggamer designed to be low level. C++ and Zile are due to performance and Zile itself transpiles into C++ during its own compilations means speed of drivers are insanely good.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously all the drivers are safe and open source means everyone can inspect and modify the driver's core with ease.</p>

<h2>What is the update cycle of OPSR-JA?</h2>
<p>Frequently asked question! The update cycle of OPSR-JA does not maintain a variable update cycle because mostly the pack new versions are released in a week or mostly per day sometimes even 2 times in a single day.</p>

<h2>Why are drivers only linux-exclusive?</h2>
<p>Minecraft has a huge audience in windows but drivers of OPSR-JA do not work in windows because they are linux compiles and designed to work with linux systems effectively. Windows violates the Privacy policies of OPSR-JA clearly because they collect a lot of user data and users cannot stop data collection completely in windows especially in Win11 22H2 which completely & clearly violates OPSR-JA Zero-Data-Collection policy and Freedom-For-Everyone policy which is why windows was not supported. MACOS restricts the applications a lot which is not good for our drivers as our drivers need to be called manually by the user. Linux is safe, stable and generally good and considered home of open source softwares and OPSR-JA is itself founded in Arch linux by ghgltggamer.</p>
<p>Again safety issues are the main reason because we want to provide the safest experience to our families which MS and Apple do not want. Drivers and the whole resource pack is completely open source you can review any part any time you want.</p>

<h2>How to backup OPSR-JA?</h2>
<p>If you want to backup OPSR-JA then you must be using a linux based system because OPSR-JA Only provides backups for linux based systems only. You must be familiar with CLI tools of linux and terminal of your operating system.</p>

<h4>Suggested Systems:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Debian</li>
    <li>Ubuntu</li>
    <li>Arch</li>
    <li>Manjaro</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry even if your distribution is different but if it is linux based then it may run backup program as well.</p>

<p>Let's suppose you are using a linux based system and want to backup OPSR-JA then follow the steps but do not follow them if you are using Windows or MAC or anything else.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Locate the Pack file (Typically in "/home/[user]/.minecraft/resourcepacks/")</li>
    <li>Extract the Resource pack file to a different location (e.g.: "/home/Documents/RP/")</li>
    <li>Extract the pack.</li>
    <li>Open the terminal in the extracted folder</li>
    <li>Fire up the backup drivers by the following command</li>
    <pre><code>./openlogs driver-backup</code></pre>
    <li>And wait until you see "backup completed with status[1]"</li>
    <li>In case you find any permission error then use the following commands.</li>
    <pre><code>sudo chmod +x openlogs
./pack_backup.opsrja</code></pre>
    <li>If you encounter a path error then check out your terminal path.</li>
    <li>If you encounter any other type of error then it may be because of broken backup which might be due to damage to OPSR-JA backup system by minecraft or by you. Check whether your OS supports Executable System of backup or not.</li>
    <li>Once the backup is done rebrand and compress the resource pack and enjoy it again!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is the backup system only available for Linux?</h2>
<p>Our backup system is only for linux because Windows CPP Compiles were not possible as G++ was not officially available for windows and there is a 3rd party tool for it called MinGW which allows to use g++ on windows but it's first of all 3rd party and secondly it's too minimalist in terms of design and portability where official G++ is of course really a robust compiler which can compile any part of our backup system as our backup system is primarily written in C++ with Zile based drivers. MAC-OS is restricted a lot which is why it's a thing of trouble for devs to bring backup system while ensuring compatibilities with other users.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Want to report any bug, error or vulnerabilities of resource pack hurry up! Make an issue or pull request for the following things whether it is due to backup system or anything else.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Want to contribute to Open Source Realism - Java feel free to add a pull request and this community will bring your dream contribution into real life.</p>

<h2>Want to use OPSR-JA as a base RP?</h2>
<p>Want to use OPSR-JA for your own resource pack? Sounds great and innovative! Download the source and start developing your own resource pack on top of OPSR-JA and do not worry for copyright (c) because no one owns OPSR-JA while it was developed by ghgltggamer originally on 09/25/2024 (MM/DD/YY) but it was developed to help the community and smaller developers to start making their own amazing resource packs!</p>
<p>OPSR-JA as a base is too advantageous because OPSR-JA always brings up the new technologies in their resource pack and OPSR-JS is currently the most advanced resource pack for the minecraft community which means it's too safe and powerful and using it as a base can give your resource packs all of the technological advantages from OPSR-JS like built-in caching system, built-in backup system, etc.</p>

<p>Free of bounds and restrictions: OPSR-JA does not restrict anything means you are fully free to use any part of OPSR-JA or even the whole resource pack for your own and you can make your resource paid or free without worrying for anything as OPSR-JA is not owned by a single person it's owned by the whole community. Thanks to GHGL TG GAMER the original author for making this possible. After downloading OPSR-JA this resource pack becomes your own individual property and you have full control on it.</p>

<h2>Zero data collection goal:</h2>
<p>As GHGLTGGAMER, a security concerned developer has introduced Zero Data collection practice means no data is collected from your machine means your data is yours and your assets are truly yours. OPSR-JA or any other product developed by GHGLTGGAMER are truly safe and follows Zero Data Collection Goal and these do not collect even a single bit of user data.</p>

<p>Feel free to publish OPSR-JA on your own platform without worrying for any copyrights (c) thanks.</p>
